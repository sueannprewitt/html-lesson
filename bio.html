	<h3>What I did before bootcamp</h3>

	<p>Before bootcamp, I was a legal assistant for 20 years.  I am ready for something new!!!<br>
	I am excited to learn the full stack and work as a .Net Developer. </p>

	<h3>Why I chose a bootcamp</h3>

	<p>I chose a bootcamp before it was less expensive and took less time than going to college. <br>
	I am hopeful to get a job as a .Net Developer shortly after completing the bootcamp.</p>

	<h3>Where I want to work after bootcamp</h3>

	<p>I would possibly like to work at TQL as it is very close to my house.  I am keeping my <br>
	options open though as I will not pass up a better opportunity somewhere else.</p>
